# Programming challenge for the Support Engineer position at Lexart

The current repository is part of the selection process for a Suppor Engineer position at Lexart. It was developed according to instructions using vanilla JavaScript and Jest as a test suite.

The instructions were as follows:
>Create an algorithm that traverses a one-dimensional array containing letters and numbers: ["a", 10, "b", "hello", 122, 15].
>
> - Obtain an array containing only letters.
>
> - Obtain an array containing only numbers.
>
> - Obtain the largest number from the previous array.


I developed the algorithm in a way that it would return an JS object containing 3 keys:
 - "strings", with the letter values array
 - "number", with the numeric values array
 - "highest", with a single numeric value corresponding to the highest number in the numeric array

I also took the liberty to develop a few unit tests to make sure everything is working. In order to run these tests please clone this repository, run the `npm install` command to install the testing depency then run `npm test`.
